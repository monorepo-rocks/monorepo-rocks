# **Best Storage and Query Engines for an LLM-Powered Code Context Engine**

Building your "mcp-context-engine" (inspired by Augment's Context Engine) will require choosing robust tools for storing and querying your codebase. Given your requirements \- multi-language support (JS/TS, Python, Go), thousands of files (not millions), natural-language queries, offline operation, and best-in-class performance \- a combination of specialized code search and vector search technologies is ideal. Below, we break down the options:

## **1\. Lexical Code Search Engine (Exact Matches & Regex)**

For precise and lightning-fast code searches (e.g., finding specific imports or function names), a dedicated code search engine is recommended over a general text search. Zoekt is a standout choice:

- **Zoekt (Open Source by Google/Sourcegraph):** Designed specifically for code, Zoekt uses a trigram index to achieve fast, accurate search with support for regex and exact matching. It eliminates false positives by indexing every 3-character sequence in code, which means queries like import chalk or getUserId() return only exact matches in context. Zoekt scales well (used to search 48 TB of code at GitLab) and provides multi-line context in results.
- **Why Not Generic Search (Elastic/OpenSearch)?:** General engines like Elasticsearch can work, but they aren't optimized for code structure. In fact, GitLab's team found Elastic/OpenSearch struggled with precision and scale for code search, prompting them to adopt Zoekt for a "better solution." Zoekt's code-aware ranking (e.g., prioritizing symbol matches) and regex support out-of-the-box give it an edge for code queries.
- **Alternatives:** Other open-source code search tools exist (OpenGrok, Hound, Livegrep). OpenGrok (maintained by Oracle) is an older but reliable code search engine (it uses Lucene under the hood). Hound (by Etsy) and Livegrep (Stripe) also provide fast trigram-based searching. However, Zoekt is considered best-in-class today \- it's actively maintained (by Sourcegraph), and proven in production for large codebases (Sourcegraph, GitLab).

**Why this matters for your project:** A tool like Zoekt can index thousands of source files (any language) and let you query instantly for exact strings or regex patterns. This covers queries such as "find imports of $ (zx) and chalk in the tools package" by quickly locating those terms in code. You can run Zoekt offline (it builds a local index file per codebase and serves queries via a Go binary or library). Its precision ensures the LLM sees the exact relevant code snippet rather than noisy or partial matches.

## **2\. Semantic Vector Search Engine (Natural Language Queries)**

To handle plain English queries and broader context questions (e.g., "How does ci.ts obtain its dependencies?"), you'll want to incorporate embedding-based semantic search. This involves encoding code and queries into high-dimensional vectors so that conceptually related text can be found even if exact keywords differ. For this, you'll need two pieces: (a) a code embedding model (preferably offline) and (b) a vector database to store/query those embeddings.

- **Vector Database Options:** There are several excellent open-source vector search engines:
  - **Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search):** A high-performance C++ library (with Python bindings) for nearest-neighbor search on dense vectors. Faiss is very fast and memory-efficient, capable of handling large vector sets (even beyond RAM by using on-disk indexes). It's a library, which you can integrate into your Python/Go code, ideal if you want an in-process solution.
  - **Chroma:** An "AI-native" open-source vector DB tailored for LLM applications. It's easy to use \- you can add embeddings with metadata (like file names, etc.) and query by similarity. Chroma excels at making document and query embeddings "plug-and-play" for LLMs. It's lightweight, runs offline (using SQLite/DuckDB under the hood for persistence), and is well-suited for thousands of vectors. The focus on embedding storage and retrieval means you can ask a natural question, embed it (via your model), and Chroma will return the most semantically relevant code snippets.
  - **Qdrant:** A production-ready vector search engine with an easy API. Notably, Qdrant supports extended filtering and hybrid search \- you can store metadata or even sparse keyword vectors alongside dense vectors. This means you could, for example, filter results to only the "tools" folder or boost results that also match certain keywords. It's a heavier solution (runs as a separate service, like a database), but still open-source and offline-deployable.
  - **Milvus:** Another popular open-source vector database built for scale. It can handle massive datasets with millisecond latency and offers both cloud and local deployment options. Milvus might be overkill for thousands of files, but it's an option if you anticipate scaling up (it shines for million+ vectors scenarios).
  - **OpenSearch (with KNN plugin):** Interestingly, OpenSearch (the open-source fork of Elastic) now has integrated vector search capabilities. It can perform hybrid queries that combine traditional keyword matching with vector similarity. This "one package" approach means you could ingest code as documents with both full-text index and vector embeddings in the same engine. OpenSearch 3.0 even supports GPU acceleration for indexing and features like semantic sentence highlighting. However, the trade-off is complexity \- running an OpenSearch cluster locally is heavier than using a purpose-built code index \+ vector library.
- **Offline Embedding Models:** To use semantic search offline, you'll need to generate embeddings for your code and queries without calling external APIs. This aligns with your security preference \- keeping code data local. (Augment Code emphasizes avoiding third-party cloud APIs for embeddings, since code embeddings can potentially be reverse-engineered to reveal source code.) For your use case, consider models like CodeBERT, UniXcoder, or InstructorXL that can be run locally to encode code snippets and natural language questions into vectors. These models are pre-trained on multiple programming languages, including JS, Python, and Go. You could also use an instruction-tuned LLM (like a Llama 2 variant) to interpret queries and produce a vector or keywords for search.

**How this helps:** With a vector search in place, a query like "How does ci.ts get its dependencies?" can be answered by semantic similarity: the engine can retrieve code blocks from ci.ts or related build scripts that "feel" relevant (even if the exact words don't match the query). This is crucial for plain English queries where the user's wording might differ from the code syntax. All of these vector databases run fully offline on your own machine or server, so they meet the no-internet requirement while still providing intelligent search capabilities.

## **3\. Hybrid Approach and Recommendations**

For a best-in-class solution, you will likely combine lexical and semantic search to leverage the strengths of each:

- **Exact vs. Semantic:** Use the code search engine (e.g., Zoekt) for pinpoint exact matches and structural queries (especially where the query includes code tokens, file names, or regex patterns). Use the vector search for high-level or ambiguous queries in natural language. For example, if the LLM asks "find all places the app config is loaded", a semantic search might surface relevant code even if the word "config" isn't explicitly mentioned everywhere (it might catch loadSettings() or YAML parsing code by similarity).
- **Integration:** You can run these systems in parallel. For each user query, your "context engine" could:
  1. **Keyword Search:** Extract obvious keywords (file names like ci.ts, identifiers like chalk, etc.) and query Zoekt (or run a grep) to get precise locations.
  2. **Vector Search:** Embed the entire question and query the vector DB to catch any relevant snippets that lexical search might miss (e.g., documentation comments or indirect references).
  3. **Combine Results:** Merge and rank the results. Many modern tools use a hybrid strategy: for instance, Qdrant allows combining dense and sparse (keyword) vectors in one query for a hybrid score. If implementing yourself, you can simply take the union of both result sets and then have your LLM weigh which snippets best answer the question.
- **Unified Solutions:** If you prefer a single engine rather than maintaining two, OpenSearch with its vector capabilities could store your code and handle both term queries and vector similarity searches in one place. It offers a comprehensive API (and even features like semantic text highlighting). Just note the overhead: running OpenSearch for a smaller project might be heavier than a lightweight Zoekt \+ Chroma/Faiss combo. For thousands of files, a dual approach is quite feasible and may actually be simpler to set up.
- **Offline & Security:** All suggested tools are open-source and can be self-hosted offline. This keeps your code secure on your machine \- an approach in line with Augment's philosophy to avoid sending code or embeddings to third parties. It also means no network latency: searches can be millisecond-fast locally, crucial for quick LLM responses.

### **Final Recommendation:**

Given your criteria, a **hybrid architecture** is optimal. Use **Zoekt** (or a similar trigram-based code search engine) as the storage/query engine for lexical code queries, ensuring fast exact matches across JS, TS, Python, and Go files. Alongside, integrate a **vector database** (such as **Chroma** for ease of use, or **Faiss** for performance) to enable semantic search on embedding vectors. This will allow your LLM to handle natural language questions by retrieving the most relevant code context. This combination represents best-in-class tooling: you get the precision of proven code search technology and the intelligence of semantic search, all running locally. By adopting these tools, your "mcp-context-engine" will effectively become a powerful, offline code assistant that can "understand" and find code based on plain English queries \- much like Augment's context engine, but tailored to your own codebase.
