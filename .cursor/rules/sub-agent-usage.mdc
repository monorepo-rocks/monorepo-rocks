<title>When to Use Sub-Agents for Task Delegation</title>

<rules>
- Use sub-agents for well-defined, mechanical tasks after creative problem-solving is complete
- Delegate comprehensive test writing once you know what to test
- Use sub-agents for systematic codebase analysis when the analysis goal is clear
- Delegate build validation, test running, and compilation verification
- Use sub-agents for implementing solutions after design decisions are made
- Keep complex debugging, problem diagnosis, and design decisions in main thread
- Delegate file creation/modification tasks with clear specifications
- Use sub-agents when token usage in main thread is high but task is routine
</rules>

<good-candidates>
- Test Implementation: Writing comprehensive test suites after identifying what needs testing
- Codebase Analysis: Systematic file analysis with specific goals (e.g., "find all places X pattern is used")
- Build & Validation: Running test suites, builds, and reporting results
- Solution Implementation: Coding changes after architectural decisions are made
- Documentation Updates: Writing/updating docs when content requirements are clear
- Pattern Detection: Finding all instances of specific code patterns across the codebase
- Refactoring Tasks: Mechanical code changes following established patterns
</good-candidates>

<stay-in-main-thread>
- Problem Diagnosis: Requires iterative thinking and user feedback
- Design Decisions: Architectural choices and solution approaches
- Conceptual Breakthroughs: Understanding complex system relationships
- User Interaction: Back-and-forth clarification and requirement gathering
- Creative Problem Solving: Novel approaches to complex issues
</stay-in-main-thread>

<decision-criteria>
- Can the task be completed with a clear, specific prompt? → Use sub-agent
- Does the task require back-and-forth with the user? → Stay in main thread
- Is the task mechanical but produces lots of output? → Use sub-agent
- Does the task require creative thinking or novel approaches? → Stay in main thread
- Are you reading/analyzing large files just to extract specific info? → Use sub-agent
- Are you implementing a solution that's already been designed? → Use sub-agent
</decision-criteria>

<example>
After discovering a bug in argument processing:
"I've identified that the convertArgsToFigArgs function incorrectly processes non-positional arguments. Please implement the fix by removing lines 609-641 that add non-positional arguments, update the function signature for convertArgsToFigOptions to accept positionalArgs parameter, and add comprehensive tests to verify the fix works correctly."
</example>
